1. create a new plan ("fall 2011 plan #1")
2. decide which courses to offer in that plan (120, 150, 225, ...) and section/campus/component/enrol_cap
3. decide who teaches the courses (ggbaker teaches CMPT 120)
4. decide meeting times/rooms
5. checks: every course has instructor, people teaching right #
6. publish to instructors
7. publish to everybody
