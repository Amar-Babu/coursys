planning workflow:
1. create a new plan ("fall 2011 plan #1")
2. decide which courses to offer in that plan (120, 150, 225, ...) and section/campus/component/enrol_cap
3. decide who teaches the courses (ggbaker teaches CMPT 120)
4. decide meeting times/rooms
5. checks: every course has instructor, people teaching right #
6. publish to instructors
7. publish to everybody

{% for instructors in instructor_list %}
	{% for instructors_check in  instructor_intention_list %}
		{% if instructors.instructor ==  instructors_check.instructor and flag != 1 %}
			{% if instructors.course ==  planned_course.course %}
				{% if planned_course.instructor ==  instructors.instructor %}
					{{ planned_course.instructor }}
					flag = 1
				{% endif %}
			{% endif %}
		{% endif %}
	{% endfor %}	
{% endfor %}

{%  if flag != 1 %}
	{{ planned_course.instructor }} (Intention Full)
{% endif %}
