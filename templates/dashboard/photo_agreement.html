As an employee of Simon Fraser University, I understand that I have a legal obligation to protect personal information, including digital identification photographs, to which I have access through this system.  In accordance with the <cite>Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act</cite>, University Policy I10.04 â€“ <cite>Access to Information and Protection of Privacy, and the Student Services Confidentiality Policy</cite> (at <a href="http://students.sfu.ca/policies/">http://students.sfu.ca/policies/</a>) I agree to protect all personal information to which I have access during the term of my appointment with the University.  I agree to use the personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and purposes consistent with my job duties.  I agree that I will disclose personal information only as permitted by law.  I understand that discipline, up to and including dismissal, may result if I, without authority, access, collect, use, disclose, or dispose of personal information.  I understand that my legal obligation continues in perpetuity after termination of my employment with Simon Fraser University and that failure to keep confidential the personal information of individuals is grounds for legal action.
