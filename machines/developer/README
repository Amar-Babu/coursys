Okay, so, I replaced the old 'fab-and-script' method of automatically building courses
with a shiny new Vagrant & Chef powered system. 

To get from 'fresh checkout' to 'deployed system', 

1. Install VirtualBox.  
2. Install Vagrant.
3. From this directory:
4. Tell Vagrant about the 'lucid32' base box.

    vagrant box add base http://files.vagrantup.com/lucid32.box

5. Start up the server.

    vagrant up

That's it. If you want to interact with the deployed system, enter

    vagrant ssh

and it will take you to an Ubuntu server containing a deployed version of the code.

    cd courses


The /courses base directory on your home system is mounted in the internal system, 
so you can edit files from your outer computer or from within the VM. 

One caveat is that, in order to make the server on the internal system visible to the
outer system, we need to forward the port, and django needs to know to allow arbitrary
access from that port - therefore, we give runserver the '0:8000' option. 

    python manage.py runserver 0:8000

Bam. Now you, too. have courses running from port 8000. 

The deps that it installs for python are located at: 

    /courses/build_deps/working_deps.txt

The primary build script that runs is located at:

    /courses/virtual_machine/chef-repo/cookbooks/coursys/recipes/default.rb
