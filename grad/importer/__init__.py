"""
All of the logic to handle import GradStudents (and GradProgramHistory, GradStatus, Supervisor) from SIMS into CourSys.

The basic idea:
 1. Everything is brought in with various SIMS queries.
 2. This is used to construct various objects that represent "happenings": status changes, program changes, committee
    members.
 3. Happenings are chopped up into "careers" that represent a unique application+unit. These correspond to GradStudent
    objects.
 4. All of the happenings know how to update themselves in CourSys: finding old versions of that fact if available and
    creating/updating as necessary.

All of this is surprisingly intricate, particularly 3. Did you know you can the same program three times concurrently,
or form a grad committee before you transfer into program (but after you applied for it but abandoned the application)?
Turns out you can, and a thousand other things.

Part 4 is tricky because we want staff to be able to enter facts before they hit SIMS (sometimes there's a long lag,
and they need them in-place before the paperwork makes it), and then confirm/polish once it's in SIMS. A lot of the
logic around this is trying to find the similar-enough fact that was manually entered and claiming it.
