As a warmup project, we will re-implement the School's existing "advisor portal" within the new system.  This system is used as a place to keep advising notes on students so they can be easily shared by the advisors.

 * system stores a series of "notes".  Each note...
   * is associated with a particular student
   * is flagged with the creation date/time, user who created it
   * can have a file attachment
 * notes cannot be edited or deleted
 * notes can be flagged as "hidden"
   * used by advisors in case of data entry error, etc.
 * access to all info allowed only to advisors
   * as set in the coredata.!OtherUser.role field
 * advisors can search for students by student number or name
   * a quickly-interactive AJAX lookup is helpful
 * student display
   * starts with summary info (whatever personal information is known)
   * tab for notes (sorted with newest first), including links to attachments
   * tab for course registrations (data from coredata.Member)
